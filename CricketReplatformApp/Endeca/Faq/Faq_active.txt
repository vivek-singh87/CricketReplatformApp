faq.seo_name|What-is-the-Federal-Universal-Service-Fund-Federal-USF-surcharge
faq.answer|The Federal Universal Service Fund is a fund that was established by the U.S. government and is used to subsidize basic telephone service for people with low incomes and those who live in rural areas. It is also used to provide Internet connections, landline handsets and mobile handsets to schools and libraries. The U.S. government imposes a fee on telecommunications carriers to fund the program.

faq.answer|Law enforcement initiates the primary emergency AMBER notification, defines the geographic boundaries of the Alert notification, and has the legal jurisdiction through the child's entry into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) to act upon the information contained in an AMBER Alert.The Department of Justice (DOJ), the agency responsible for coordination of AMBER Alerts on the national level, has asked the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to act as its agent for coordination of secondary AMBER dissemination. NCMEC's role is to receive AMBER Alerts from DOJ and disseminate those Alerts to secondary distributors, as approved by NCMEC.Wireless AMBER Alert, an NCMEC-approved secondary distributor, will rapidly transmit the approximately 200-250 abducted children bulletins that are issued annually to wireless carriers to receive and deploy AMBER Alerts to their subscribers in a designated region based on zip code, that have opted-in to receive the bulletins. Information transmitted will be the same regardless of the customer's wireless provider and make and model of their phone.

faq.seo_name|Can-I-use-my-current-mobile-phone-with-Cricket-service
faq.answer|If your phone has already been flashed to Cricket your phone can be activated for Cricket service. However, since your phone was designed to work on another carrier&rsquo;s network not all of the Cricket network features may work even though the phone was flashed to Cricket&rsquo;s network.&nbsp; If you would like to experience all the features Cricket network has to offer you may want to consider purchasing a Cricket phone. Cricket only supports voice features and text messaging for non-Cricket phones.

faq.answer|Customers on most Cricket monthly service plans have picture messaging included at no extra charge.&nbsp; For Cricket customers whose plans do not include unlimited&nbsp;picture messaging,&nbsp;the feature can be added for &nbsp;just $5 per month plus tax and fees (if applicable).&nbsp; You will receive unlimited usage without any airtime charges or per message fees. That means you can send and receive as many messages as you want.

faq.question|What are premium text messaging purchases?
faq.seo_name|What-are-premium-text-messaging-purchases
faq.answer|Premium text message purchases allow you to purchase mobile content using short codes for your Cricket phone such as: ringtones, images or wallpapers, games, interactive TV voting, premium chat/date applications, premium text message alerts and other premium mobile applications. &nbsp; You discover this type of content by the advertising of media companies, consumer brands, billboards, third-party content provider websites and word-of-mouth. Popular examples of text message purchases are:<ul><li>Sending a text message via a short code to cast your vote on your favorite television show with your wireless phone. </li><li>Visiting a 3rd party website that sells ringtones and wallpapers, selecting an item, and choosing the &ldquo;Send To My Phone&rdquo; option. </li></ul>When you see an advertisement you are interested in, submit a purchase request by sending a text message (usually a keyword) to a short code OR select the &ldquo;Send to my Phone&rdquo; option on a website after you have selected the desired content you wish to purchase. A short code is a number to which an SMS or text message can be sent. A short code is fewer digits than a 10-digit telephone number. For example, a short code could be 54321. &nbsp; Once you text your purchase request, you will receive a text message back with an advice-of-charge; terms and conditions; and consumer help information for the item you wish to purchase from the 3rd party content provider or merchant.  &nbsp; After you accept these terms and conditions, your Flex Bucket funds&nbsp;are charged for the transaction and the content or mobile application is downloaded to your handset for personal use.

faq.question|How does Cricket PAYGo work?
faq.seo_name|How-does-Cricket-PAYGo-work
faq.answer|Cricket PAYGo is a prepaid product. You purchase service in advance by <a href="http://www.mycricket.com/paygo/topup">adding funds to your account</a>. As you use your service, you&rsquo;ll decrease the funds in your account. Just top-up when you start to run low to keep using your Cricket PAYGo service.With Cricket PAYGo monthly plans, you decide which plan has the best unlimited features and the right number of included minutes for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever plan you select, when you pay your access fee, you&rsquo;ll have access to all the features included with your plan, as well as other services and features for an additional charge. See&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mycricket.com/support/faq/How-do-Cricket-PAYGo-monthly-plans-work">How do Cricket PAYGo monthly plans work?</a> or <a href="http://www.mycricket.com/support/faq/How-do-Cricket-PAYGo-Muve-Music-plans-work">How do Cricket PAYGo Muve Music plans work?</a> for more information.You will never be charged for things outside of your control (like receiving a text message or letting an incoming call go to voicemail), for managing your account (for example, calling Customer Care or *PAY), or certain other services (like calling 911 or browsing the Cricket storefront).To help you keep your service uninterrupted, PAYGo customers on a monthly plan can enroll in <a title="Auto top up" href="http://www.mycricket.com/support/faq/What-is-Cricket-PAYGo-Auto-Top-Up">Auto Top-Up</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; If you aren&rsquo;t enrolled in Auto Top-Up, we&rsquo;ll remind you to top-up when your account balance is $5 or less or if your account has five days or fewer to expiration. If you cross one of these thresholds, we&rsquo;ll send you a text message, and we&rsquo;ll remind you each time you place a call (you&rsquo;ll have the option to continue to your call or connect to *PAY to top-up). If you don&rsquo;t have enough funds in your account to pay for a service, we&rsquo;ll let you know. You&rsquo;ll need to top-up before you can use that service.

faq.answer|Topping-up is how you pay. When you top-up, you're adding funds to&nbsp;your account - you can&nbsp;add funds with a&nbsp;PIN, or you can&nbsp;add funds&nbsp;directly to your account.&nbsp;As you use your service, your account balance will be decreased. If you don&rsquo;t top-up before you use your funds, you may not have funds available when you want to use service. If you don&rsquo;t top-up before your account expiration date, your account will expire and you&rsquo;ll lose any funds still in your account. You have 60 days to top-up after account expiration, or your account will be canceled and you&rsquo;ll lose your phone number. Remember &ndash; it&rsquo;s important to top-up!

faq.question|How do I top-up my Cricket PAYGo account?
faq.seo_name|How-do-I-topup-my-Cricket-PAYGo-account
faq.answer|There are three ways to top-up your account &ndash; by first purchasing a PIN and then redeeming the PIN to your account, by adding funds directly to your account or, if you have a PAYGo monthly plan, by enrolling in PAYGo Auto Top-Up. To add funds with a PIN, you must call the number on the card or receipt and enter the PIN before you can use the funds. When you add funds to your account directly, you don&rsquo;t need to redeem a PIN, and you can use the funds right away (in some cases, it may take up to 15 minutes for the funds to post to your account).&nbsp; When you are enrolled in Auto Top-Up, your account will be automatically topped-up each month on the last day of your monthly service period.<strong>Add Funds With a PIN</strong>You can buy top-up cards and PINs at many Cricket PAYGo locations. Top-up cards and PINs are available in values ranging from $10 to $45, depending on retailer and region. Depending on the Cricket PAYGo location, you can pay with cash, check, credit card, or debit card. Use our <a href="http://account.mycricket.com/cricketlocations">store locator</a> to find a Cricket PAYGo location near you.If you have a top-up card or PIN already, follow the instructions on the card or receipt to add the funds to your account. If you are having trouble, please contact Customer&nbsp;Care at 1-800-CRICKET so we can help you.<strong>Add Funds Directly to Your Account</strong>At some locations, you can add funds directly to you account without purchasing a PIN first. This is a great way to add funds to your account because it is flexible and convenient &ndash; you can top-up your account with amounts as little as $1 and as much as $300, and there&rsquo;s no extra phone call to make to redeem a PIN. Depending on the Cricket PAYGo location, you can pay with cash, check, credit card, or debit card.Topping-up your account is always easy from your phone. &nbsp;go to My Account via the mobile web or tap on the My Account icon (looks like a money bag) on your phone's home screen and click "Top-Up".You can also use *PAY (*729) to top-up with your credit card. Just dial *PAY or call Customer&nbsp;Care to top-up in amounts as little as $1 or use our <a href="http://account.mycricket.com/cricketlocations">store locator</a> to find a Cricket PAYGo location near you.<strong>Add Funds with Auto Top-Up</strong>If you have a PAYGo monthly plan, you can enroll in our PAYGo Auto Top-Up program which provides reassurance that your service will always be paid for in advance, and your service will remain uninterrupted.&nbsp; Your account will be topped-up automatically each month, on your service period end-date, for your next service period.&nbsp; No action will be required of you once you are enrolled in PAYGo Auto Top-Up.

faq.answer|Local number portability lets you "port" (transfer) an existing telephone number from your current phone service provider to another carrier. This means you can keep your current phone number when you change your wireless service to Cricket, as long as Cricket provides service in the same location as your current provider. There are three types of portability:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireless to wireless2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireline to wireless (transferring your home phone to your cell phone or vice versa)3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireline to wireline

faq.seo_name|Can-I-dial-911-during-the-transfer-process
faq.answer|Wireless carriers are working together to ensure that 911 emergency calls will be minimally impacted while you transfer your number. When porting your number from or to any carrier, you need to plan for emergencies. If you call 911 from your NEW phone after you requested number portability, but before the port is complete, a 911 call center will not be able to call you back. It is vitally important that you provide accurate location information and that you remain on the line after calling 911 until advised that it is all right to hang up. If the call is disconnected before location and details have been provided, call 911 again, identify yourself and advise the 911 operator that you were disconnected.Likewise, if you call 911 from your OLD phone after you requested number portability and after the port is complete, a 911 call center will not be able to call you back.

faq.answer|Warranty guidelines are imposed by the original manufacturer of the data modem and not by Cricket. Warranty replacement modems are offered to our customers as a value added service. If you would like to have the original modem manufacturer handle your warranty issue you may use the manufacturer contact information below.All warranty modem replacements require a service fee, as described below. As part of this value added service, Cricket will replace your modem with a factory refurbished modem.&nbsp; The replacement modem comes with a 90 day warranty and, if applicable, the warranty may be extended to cover the remaining warranty period of your original in-warranty modem.&nbsp;Your original modem will be sent to the manufacturer&rsquo;s Authorized Service Center (ASC) and they will determine if the modem problem is covered by warranty.&nbsp; There is a $20 non-refundable fee.&nbsp;If the manufacturer&rsquo;s ASC determines the modem problem is not covered by warranty, the $20.00 will be non-refundable.&nbsp; Factory refurbished modems follow the same guidelines as above during the warranty period (up to one year from the original modem purchase date or 90 days since last in warranty exchange, whichever is longer).

faq.answer|The difference is how you pay for these services. Features or services that you &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; to your plan appear as a monthly recurring charge on your Cricket bill. Whereas with Flex Bucket, you simply purchase funds as needed.For example, if you have roaming minutes added to your plan each month as an add-on, and you use all of your roaming minutes, you would then have to purchase Flex Bucket funds in order to gain additional roaming minutes.All products available on the Cricket storefront require Flex Bucket funds to pay for them and may not be added to your monthly bill.
